    <p>Call me Matt! I was raised in Australia but I am Filipino, mainly from the regions of Cebu and Leyte where Binisaya is spoken. It’s a dialect in the Philippines. I’m currently 17, with my birthday on June 25th and I graduated from year 12 at Suzanne Cory High School in Hoppers Crossing; currently studying IT to get into the cybersecurity field. I used to be a Music Captain at my high school but I loved working on the more technical sides (amps, mics and whatnot).<br><br>
    A fun fact about me is I used to do longboarding; which is essentially a wider skateboard used for cruising. Down below is the one that I use. It’s nice for breezing around in open spaces and is much smoother and quicker than a regular skateboard.</p>

  <h2>Interest in IT &#128173;</h2>
    <p>My main interest in IT was mainly cybersecurity and IT ethics. My sister often told me stories about her friend as a security engineer and it always intrigued me how people could develop ways to obtain information and data in a way I could never comprehend. This festered inside me since I had a deep obsession with the aspects of the Dark Web and the Deep Web and I always wanted to explore them myself but realised I needed to protect myself first. So, I wanted to learn how cybersecurity and IT, in general, worked as I liked working with any sort of technology and wanted to understand how cybersecurity could be useful in the modern world. The idea that there are people who protect data and engaged in “cyber warfares” to protect against cybercrime fascinated me and appealed to my nerdier side of my love for technology. I was always keen to work in a job where I could be surrounded by tech and I now have that opportunity to do so.</p>
    <p>My sister often explained how her friend worked in an IT security team for a bank that often required them regularly test the defence and various methods that could be used to gain sensitive information. One such example was my friend’s team (the red team) offered a mail to the administration desk with a USB inside tagged “insert into the computer” which they did as instructed. This cause a shutdown across the bank’s network and prompted the bank to give stricter rules to the administration team. Hearing about this often made me laugh but I remember I downloaded a DS 3D emulator as a child which turned out to be a virus. So hearing these kinds of stories made me wonder if I could do something to prevent such things as a virus or malware attacking a computer and fix the thing that I usually broke.</p>
    <p>I chose RMIT because I heard it was a great place if you wanted to take computer science-based subjects. My sister also went to RMIT and found it to be easier if I chose a university that I knew someone went to before to get prior knowledge. But RMIT also offered me the most direct course that I wanted to take to become cybersecurity at the expense of transport and city convenience. Other universities had vague courses; some offered it but with add-ons or were simply too far to reach. I think RMIT also provided an interesting course outline that I could understand and rationalise without wondering if it was worth it.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn everything there is to IT. I want to feel confident in the IT field as well as pick up some things that might be useful along the way. I have been excited to learn to code and practice new techniques that could adapt to any project whilst being proficient at the required task. But I would also like to develop a new understanding of the concepts about security and ethics in the industry to grasp the field of cybersecurity.</p>

  <h2>Ideal Job &#128170;</h2>
    <h5> My ideal job in the IT field would be a Chief Information Security Officer;</h5>

    <p>A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is an executive tasked with the management, enforcement and progression of an information security program. They consider possible internal and external threats to communications, data, programs and assets; finding solutions to prevent breaches in security. This can be a range from policies and system administration to managing IT teams and procedures.  This particular job type resonates with me as I often would like to handle leadership positions like a senior executive whilst still being able to design, test and improve security measures. Being able to bring influence to organisations and governing bodies through IT-know-how has been such a big appeal to me. Especially with the growing concern for security within the virtual world, getting to be a part of such an industry that I find to be so influential strikes me as a fun and meaningful career.</p>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3947022/COSC1078/main/s3947022/main/Job.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABSVJFGJGWGPW3QYWMJI5D2OYSBOFUQ" width="654" height="975">
    <p>Chief Information Security Officers have a multitude of qualifications and skills required to handle such a position but it’s important to understand that multiple years of experience in I T security; especially at an administrative/leadership position is a prime factor to achieving the job. Experience in business management, security risk management and knowledge of cybersecurity tech and procedures are such vital components. Thus, they need to provide insights into potential growth and limitations to their organisations through their study and experience with computer software and hardware. Strong analytical thinking combined with interpersonal and communication skills allows CISOs to work across the field with various level employees to create cohesiveness and efficacy whilst being able to communicate on a business level from a technical perspective. Developing and enforcing incident produces to prevent intrusions with audits and reports iterate how CISOs must have critical thinking abilities to better improve a company’s security.</p>
    <p>I currently have no experience that correlates with this field or job. Regarding my skill set and qualifications; the most I can relate to was a short course in HTML and CSS that I took years ago, however this only acts as a bare bone structure for my ability to comprehend coding and IT concepts.</p>
    <p>To attain such a high-level position, years of experience and dedication to the field is a must. After graduation with a relevant degree, I could start with an entry-level position like a:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security Admin</li>
        <li>Network or Systems Admin</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This can later move on to more technical positions such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Security analyst or engineer</li>
        <li>Penetration Tester</li>
        <li>Security Consultant</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Ideally, the next step would be to attain a senior position that would build on skills related to leadership and project management like:
      <ul>
        <li>Security Manager </li>
        <li>IT Project Manager </li>
        <li>Security Architect or Director </li>
      </ul>

    <p>Moving through such positions would allow me to build on the technical experience before developing them and applying it with communicative and leadership skills to target a position of CISO</p>

  <h2>Personality Profile &#129504;</h2>
    <p>Compiling together all the data gathered from the three tests; has permitted me to evaluate my capabilities and limitations as a person. The Myers-Briggs test showed that I am an INFP-T which is known as a meditator. This highlights for me that I am a strong empath, able to sense and communicate what those around me feel or think; thus I am capable of being open-minded idealistic. But I am also prone to procrastination and highly self-critical of my faults whilst being unrealistic of my expectations. The Myers Brigg test is designed to assess an individual’s strengths and weaknesses to reflect where their skill set is most valuable and impactful. The learning style test showcased that I am a tactile/kinetic learner meaning I learn best by doing it; breaking down tasks and examples to better understand them. I find this to be useful to learning IT as its a very hands-on field and picking up skills such as coding and website set-ups can develop as I can break down my mistakes and practice them to improve. The Big Five test is a measure of five traits; Neurotic, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. My results assess that I’m more prone to negative feelings, more towards being creative and imaginative and more involved with cooperation and social harmony. These results share a resemblance to the Myer-Briggs test of being open minding and valuing agreement whilst highlighting my weakness of being prone to anxiety, self-doubt and lack of social engagement or self-control.</p>

    <p>These current results indicate that I would a be strong team player, able to provide support and guidance; yet I would be vulnerable to self-doubt and procrastination. In a team setting, I would be much more interested in a team that actively engages with each other rather than self mediated tasks assign to various members. Because I have a high tendency to be agreeable, if arguments break out, I would be stressed as I’d be more focused on the people rather than the task at hand. While these results depict my role and impact in a team, I believe that this encourages me to be more aware of my own involvement and work ethic as to not fall behind in the team and not overwhelm myself with others’ burdens that are not directly affecting me or in my jurisdiction to act. I am an emotional person that can communicate empathetically so I ensure that the people I work with are people I enjoy working with.</p>

    <p>When forming a team, I should consider people who can support my shortcomings and not dissuade me from participation. I should be careful if I take a leadership position or role as my personality tests indicate that my management capability could be hindered by my idealism and expectations with my colleagues. Ideally, if I can find people that I can communicate well with and or provide me with guidance I can be a more effective and productive member. Working with those who are optimistic or positive are also strong targets as it means I’m more willing to listen to criticisms.</P>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3947022/COSC1078/main/s3947022/main/Five.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABSVJFGIBOXSZY5LJ5HSAA76YSBOFRQ" width="1071" height="713">
    <p>Overall, the validity of each of these tests can be attributed to a grain of salt. Personality tests are useful for indicating and interpreting possible employees or colleagues but are not the defining factor as to who that person is or how they will act in various scenarios. Such tests are a broad spectrum and people can change depending on variables that may or not may be within our given control. So, we have to take each test with hesitancy and should not be constricted by what we get.</p>
